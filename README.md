With _AndroidTimeMachine_ we present a graph-based dataset of commit history of real-world Android apps.

![AndroidTimeMachine](/logo/AndroidTimeMachine.png){: .logo}

The project provides a dataset of 8,431 real-world
open-source Android apps. It combines source and commit history
information available on GitHub with the metadata from Google
Play store.
The [graph representation used for structuring the data](/dataset#graph-database-content)
eases the analysis of the relationships between source code and
metadata. The dataset is provided as [Docker containers](/dockerImages)
to improve its accessibility and extensibility.

You can find detailed information on our [data colletion process](/dataset)
and follow the [guide to accessing _AndroidTimeMachine_ data](/guide).

_AndroidTimeMachine_ is presented at [the data showcase track of MSR 2018](/publications#a-graph-based-dataset-of-commit-history-of-real-world-android-apps).
Based on this dataset we additionally built a [classifier for self-reported activities of Android developers](/publications#self-reported-activities-of-android-developers).
