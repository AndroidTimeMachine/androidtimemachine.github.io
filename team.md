## Alberto Bacchelli

![Alberto Bacchelli](/public/img/alberto.jpg){: .team-member}

I am SNSF professor at the University of Zurich ([UZH](http://www.uzh.ch/en.html)), where I am leading the Zurich Empirical Software Engineering Team ([ZEST](http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/zest.html)).

Before joining UZH, I have worked four years as assistant professor at Delft University of Technology ([TU Delft](http://www.tudelft.nl/)), The Netherlands, after which I received tenure. I obtained my Ph.D. in 2013 under the supervision of Prof. Michele Lanza, working in the REVEAL research group, at the Faculty of Informatics, of the University of Lugano ([USI](http://www.usi.ch/)). I have been intern twice (2012 and 2013) at Microsoft Research ([MSR](http://research.microsoft.com/)) in Redmond, USA, working with Dr. Christian Bird

I obtained my bachelor and master degrees in computer science from University of Bologna ([UniBO](http://www.cs.unibo.it/en/)), also studying one year at the Université Libre De Bruxelles ([ULB](http://www.ulb.ac.be/)) during my Master. After obtaining the master degree, I also have worked in industry for year at [Cineca](http://www.cineca.it/en), the largest Italian computing center.

## Ivano Malavolta

![Ivano Malavolta](/public/img/ivano.jpg){: .team-member}

I am assistant professor at the Software and Services group of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the University of L’Aquila, Italy. Currently, my research activity is positioned in the following fields: data-driven software engineering, software architecture, Model-Driven Engineering, and mobile-enabled systems. I am especially interested in investigating on how MDE techniques can be exploited for architecting complex and mobile-enabled software systems at the right level of abstraction. I am program committee member and reviewer of international conferences and journals in those fields of interest.

I am a strong advocate of applying academic research results in real scenarios, and I am working on projects that have been awarded as the most innovative solutions in both national and international venues. I am member of the ACM and the IEEE.

I am also a freelance developer and designer of Mobile and Web Applications.
